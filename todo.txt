for client side
In utilities page, maybe add on utilities tab
 - Add ui (grid) for list builds available, maybe sort into test types
 - at end of each row of builds, a button named Analyze Failure types? which will get the buildid and call backend api

for server side
- get build based on build -> run function for each data to analyze fail type -> return data to the db

- Add new sql to get all failures and errors from a build id 
- a function with the input of an build run and output of same build run but different fail type
- function will call the model ai to analyze build
- add new sql to edit data to the db  

- create the model ai


Data to do
- need image for each error to better analyze the fail type
- Add keywords in a json file based on the errors
sample: 
{
'error': "Timed out" // if timeout keyword is found in a text there is a high prob that this is a Environment/server issue
'fail_type': "Environment Issue"
},

{
'error': "Timed out while waiting 0000ms" // if timeout keyword is found in a text there is a high prob that this is a Environment/server issue
'fail_type': "Environment Issue"
},
